"""Built-in models. M-LEGACY is the compatibility path: a run with no fence_model
event resolves to it, and it must reproduce today's behaviour exactly.

It declares centre_to_centre deliberately. golden-scenarios.md:23 says rails are
cut to "clear width" while demand/derive.py:63 cuts to span.width_mm, which is
centre-to-centre. That disagreement predates this work and CLAUDE.md forbids
reconciling it silently, so M-LEGACY preserves the CODE's behaviour and the
scenario text is settled separately through the golden-scenarios skill.
